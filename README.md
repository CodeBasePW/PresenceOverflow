# PresenceOverflow
Adds a nice UI that allows you to change your Discord Rich Presence.

## How To
To begin, start the program. The most needed things are the State and App ID. All other things aren't required. To get the App ID, head over [here](https://www.discordapp.com/developers) and create an application. Go into the application and copy the **Client ID**. That's what your App ID is. <br>
The state is your choice, and so is the details. <br>
The small and big image keys are not your choice, but the image is. Go back into your discord application and click on **Rich Presence**, then go to **Art Assets**. At the bottom, there's a button called **Add Image(s)**. Add an image, and copy what the image name is. The name is the key. The captions are whatever you want them to be.<br>

**s h o** is the application's name.
