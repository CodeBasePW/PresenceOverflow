# PresenceOverflow
Adds a nice UI that allows you to change your Discord Rich Presence.

## How To
#### Beginning
Firstly, head over [here](https://www.discordapp.com/developers) and create an application. Go into the application and copy the **Client ID**. Start PresenceOverflow, and put the client id as the **App ID**. To start it, you need both the **App ID** and the **State** (shown in the image). The details section is optional.
#### Images
The big image key, and small image key are things you need to set within Discord. Go back into your discord application and click on **Rich Presence**, then go to **Art Assets**. At the bottom, there's a button called **Add Image(s)**. Add an image, and copy what the image name is. That's the key for either small or big for that image. Captions are optional.
